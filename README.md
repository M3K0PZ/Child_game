# Child_game
I created this repo for my internship, I had to develop a small game using phaser (js framework). The game had to be playable on a phone, easy to pick-up with no reading knowledge, it's made for children from 4 to 6 years of age, for 65 different languages (I had never coded in js nor phaser before this project)

# Shape Swing

Shape Swing is a game I created during an internship project at orleansgames.com, using the javascript framework phaser, which took approximately one month to complete. The objective was to develop my first real game using unfamiliar technologies and relying solely on theoretical knowledge. This project was undertaken as part of my final year at Polytech Grenoble ( 10th ranked engineering school in France : l'Ã©tudiant ranking).

This was my first javasrcipt project.

## Rules 
The rules were to make a game for childrens for 4 to 10 years old, for 65 different languages. The CEO asked us to make a game without any form of text (appart from the title) and make it easy to understand.

As orleansgames.com is a ludo-educative website, the game has to teach to the player.


# The game in a nutshell

- The game is about matching shapes, the player has to drag&drop a shape to send it flying therefore aiming for the same shape and to collect it (all shapes collected = win)

- the player has 3 lifes.

- the player can replay anytime, skip levels and play the one he wants by a menu (it's for kids)

- pixelated art & music, appart from the tilemap, i made everything myslef ( icons, shapes, backgrounds, etc..)

# my thought about the project 

It went quite well since : 
- i never used Javascript
- I never used Phaser 
- I never Fully developped a game only by myslef

If i where to redo the same project, I'd change so many things in the code!
I learned a lot, and not only syntax, but game oriented ways of coding, more perfoming and secured ones.

When i look back to my code, trying to make a full game in one month was quite the rush, and with more time I'd rewrite the code to be more optmized and structured, but it's ok anyways now (no performance issue, some improvements needs to be made but it's working well and without any bugs (for now ?))

feel free to take a look into my code !
